      <p>
    *Understand the role of the Threat Intelligence Platform in a SOC<br />
    *Use the MISP Threat Intelligence Platform to ingest threat data<br />
    *Create a MISP event with information from an open-source report<br />
    *Push information from a MISP event to TheHive for Triage<br />
      </p>
  Lab2: []<br />
      Lab 2.1:- Exploring DNS
       <p>
    *Run a DNS Server (Pi-Hole) to see how it accepts, records, and forwards requests<br />
    *Manually generate DNS requests from the command line to our Pi-Hole DNS server using "dig"<br />
    *Log in to the DNS server and see the information it records from client lookups<br />
    *Look at the packets of the DNS traffic in Wireshark<br />
    *Use Suricata IDS signatures to detect suspicious DNS requests<br />
    *Use DNS event logs recorded by Suricata to identify DNS tunneling in a SIEM<br />
      </p>
      Lab 2.2:- MISP Threat Intelligence Platform
      <p>

    *Push information from a MISP event to TheHive for Triage<br />
      </p>
      Lab 2.3:- SMTP and Email Analysis
      <p>
    *See SMTP mail relay in action on your virtual machine<br />
    *Follow a normal email through two MTA servers<br />
    *Manually send a spoofed message via telnet and see how it appears in a mail client<br />
    *Examine known malicious email and identify spoofing and threats within the message content<br />
      </p>
      
  Lab3: []<br />
      Lab 3.1:- Interpreting Windows Logs
       <p>
    *Learn to find and interpret key Windows logs<br />
    *Learn how Windows logs are commonly stored in a SIEM<br />
    *Explore different log files and channels to find data of interest<br />
      </p>
      Lab 3.2:- Log Enrichment and Visualization
      <p>
    Understand the flow of log data into a SIEM<br />
    *See various types of log formats and understand the implications for parsing<br />
    *Understand the importance of correct log parsing<br />
    *Understand how a SIEM performs normalization, enrichment, and categorization<br />
    *Use data supplement with enrichment and categorization to visualize attack trend<br />
      </p>
      Lab 3.3:- SMTP and Email Analysis
      <p>
    *See SMTP mail relay in action on your virtual machine<br />
    *Follow a normal email through two MTA servers<br />
    *Manually send a spoofed message via telnet and see how it appears in a mail client<br />
    *Examine known malicious email and identify spoofing and threats within the message content<br />
      </p>
  Lab4: []<br />
      Lab 4.1:- Alert Triage & Prioritization
       <p>
    *Apply the kill-chain to a set of alerts for triage<br />
    *Use supporting evidence to help disposition incoming alerts<br />
    *Use PCAPs and context to make alert triage decisions<br />
    *Use a full PCAP engine (Moloch) to assist in triaging a late-stage attack<br />
      </p>
      Lab 4.2:- Structured Analysis Challenge
      <p>
    *Translate a user report into investigative evidence<br />
    *Gather additional data to investigate an ambiguous alert<br />
    *Use the ACH process to analyze evidence and draw conclusions<br />
    *Write up a reasoned analysis based on gathered evidence to resolve an incident<br />
      </p>
      Lab 4.3:- Collecting and Documenting Incident Information
      <p>   
    *Investigate the individual steps of an attack<br />
    *Document the findings using a playbook in an incident management system<br />
    *Document observables with details of how they were used<br />
    *Close the case writing a easily consumable attack and impact summary of the findings<br />
  </p>
  Lab5: []<br />
      Lab 5.1:- Alert Tuning
     <p>
    *Look at a set of alerts from an untuned IDS<br />
    *Translate detection and compliance requirements into filter conditions<br />
    *Tune an IDS to detect attacks to an externally available web server<br />
    *Filter out unrelated alerts from a default IDS rule set<br />
      </p>
      Lab 5.2:- Security Automation    
    *Become familiar with flow based programming for automation<br />
    *Create a workflow to automatically new files inside a folder and calculate their hash<br />
    *Submit the calculated file hash via HTTP API to a virus check site and read the results<br />
    *Send an automated email when the file results indicate a virus was found<br />
